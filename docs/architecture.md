# ðŸ§© KMS Monitor â€“ Architecture

## Overview
**KMS Monitor** is a modular key monitoring system that:
- Logs keystrokes locally
- Encrypts them with Fernet symmetric encryption
- Emails the encrypted logs securely via SMTP
- Provides a Streamlit dashboard to view & decrypt logs

## Flow

1. **Logging** â€“ `kms.py` uses `pynput` to log keystrokes via `utils/logger.py`.
2. **Encryption** â€“ Logs are encrypted using `utils/crypto.py` (:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}).
3. **Email Sending** â€“ Encrypted logs are sent to the configured recipient using `utils/sender.py` via :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} SSL.
4. **Monitoring Dashboard** â€“ `dashboard/app.py` provides a :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} UI to view and decrypt uploaded logs.
5. **CI Pipeline** â€“ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint checks and tests on each push.
